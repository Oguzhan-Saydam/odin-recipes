    <h1>Classic Chicken Salat</h1>
    
    <p>Of all the summer salads, a classic chicken salad recipe is always a favorite at a picnic, a barbecue, or an office potluck! Just a few ingredients can be transformed into a cold, creamy salad or filling for a homemade chicken salad sandwich or wrap!</p>

    <h1>Ingredients in Chicken Salad</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Chicken:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use leftovers from yesterday or leftover rotissiere chicken or grilled chicken.</li>
        <li>You can use canned chicken in a pinch but of course fresh is best when possible.</li>
        <li>Ensure the chicken is cooled and shred or chop the chicken into bite sized pieces.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Add-ins:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>As this is a classic chicken salad recipe, I’ve kept the additions to a minimum. Celery for crunch, green onions for flavor.</li>
        <li>This recipe can be made with a variety of nuts, veggies, and fruit for added flavor and texture.</li>
        <li>Chicken salad with grapes, avocado or dried cranberries is a favorite. Pecans or almonds pair well with this recipe.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Dressing:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mayonnaise is the base of this recipe and it’s simply seasoned.</li>
        <li>You can get creative and substitute some of the mayo for ranch dressing or your favorite salad dressing recipe.</li>
        <li>Create an Avocado Chicken Salad by replacing some of the mayonnaise with mashed avocado.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>How to Make a Chicken Salad</h1>

    <p>Prepare a classic chicken salad in 15 minutes with only a few simple ingredients.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Chop</strong> cooked and cooled chicken and place into a large bowl with celery and onions.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix</strong>dressing ingredients (per recipe below) in a bowl. Toss with chicken</li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong>on rolls, bread or over a leaf of lettuce</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For this chicken salad sandwich recipe, any bread will do, thick slices of a baguette or buns/rolls hold up well. This is naturally low carb and it’s great over a tossed salad as well.</p>
