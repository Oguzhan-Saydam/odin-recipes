    <p>This traditional Turkish menemen recipe is quick and easy to make with a few basic ingredients, and extra-delicious when served up with some good crusty bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsb olive oil</li>
        <li>2 onions, sliced</li>
        <li>1 red or green pepper, halved deseeded and sliced</li>
        <li>1-2 red chillies, deseeded and sliced</li>
        <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>small bunch parsley, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>6 tbsp thick, creamy yoghurt</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
    </ul>    

    <h2>How to Make Menemen</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>

    <p>Heat the oil in a heavy-based frying pan. Stir in the onions, pepper and chillies. Cook until they begin to soften. Add the tomatoes and sugar, mixing well. Cook until the liquid has reduced, season.</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>

    <p>Using a wooden spoon, create 4 pockets in the tomato mixture and crack the eggs into them. Cover the pan and cook the eggs over a low heat until just set.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>

    <p>Beat the yogurt with the garlic and season. Sprinkle the menemen with parsley and serve from the frying pan with a dollop of the garlic-flavoured yogurt.</p>
